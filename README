tex_workspace
=============
  These scripts were made for setting
up MiKTeX environment in docker/podman
container. They don't differ a lot form
default instructions on MiKTeX website

requirements:
  - podman (or docker)

HOW TO USE:
    run `prepare.sh` once
    use `run.sh <file>` to build .tex files
    (you can copy or symlink this script anywhere you want)

NOTE:   If you are using docker do `git apply docker.patch`
      before using `run.sh`. Also, make sure your user is in
      the 'docker' group.

Tested on:
  - CentOS 8 Stream (release 8.4.2105) with podman (version 3.2.3)
  - openSUSE Tumbleweed (20210921) with docker (version 20.10.6-ce)
