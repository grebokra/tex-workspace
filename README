=============
  These scripts were made for setting
up MiKTeX environment in docker/podman
container. They don't differ a lot form
default instructions on MiKTeX website

requirements:
  - podman (or docker)

NOTE:   If you are using docker do `git apply docker.patch`
      before using `run.sh`

Tested only on CentOS 8 Stream (CentOS Linux release 8.4.2105)
with podman (podman version 3.2.3)
